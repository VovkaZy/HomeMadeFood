# HomeMadeFood

*HomeMade Food* is my own project, helping me to learn Ruby on Rails closely.
An idea of this project is similar to other sharing-based marketplaces like AirBnB, Uber, etc.
This is online marketplace for people who likes to cook at home and want to earn some money with this. With this online marketplace they can share food with neighbors, get reviews about their dishes, stars for quality and service, earn money and many more.
